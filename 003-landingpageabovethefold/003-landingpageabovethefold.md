# 003 - Landing Page (above the fold)

Hint: What's the main focus? Is it for a book, an album, a mobile app, a product? Consider important landing page elements (call-to-actions, clarity, etc.) 

## Final Thoughts

Found [this awesome picture](https://unsplash.com/photos/XVTWFHcNIko) of a black bicycle at Unsplashed by [Josh Nuttall](http://unsplash.com/@jjnuttall?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge) and I felt I needed to use it as a product of my Landing Page.

The challenge asked for an "above the fold" landing page with important elements (call-to-actions, clarity, etc). So I went with a simple form for a waiting list sign up. Made up the name of a bike and gave it an Apple-like subtitle, because why not? Haha.
