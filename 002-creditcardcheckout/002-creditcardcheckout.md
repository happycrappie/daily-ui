# 002 - Credit Card Checkout

Hint: Design a credit card checkout form or page. Don't forget the important elements such as the numbers, dates, security numbers, etc. 

## Final thoughts

It's been awhile since I wanted to try something visual on a smartwatch. I've never used one, but it seems like something very intuitive, so I gave it a shot.

I didn't want a view with too much information, I wanted only what mattered to the person. 

The app shows one of the credit cards the user has saved on the device with basic credit card info and the payment value. It also gives you the option to cancel, pay or even select other credit cards by sliding right or left.

I figured that was intuitive enough.
