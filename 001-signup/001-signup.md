# 001 - Sign Up

Hint: Design a sign up page, modal, form, app screen, etc.

## Final Thoughts

I wanted to create a simple, yet effective Sign Up view. I used a picture from Unsplashed and applied a block of gradient with opacity to make it pretty while also taking the focus out of the picture. 

Since I needed context, I decided to create a fake app called "Shelf" - that would be an app for curating books and other reads. I put together a few blocks to make it look like books in a shelf. 

Other than that, I followed the standart form asking for a Full Name, E-mail and Password while also asking if the user already has an account.

I'm happy with the result as for my first published UI.
